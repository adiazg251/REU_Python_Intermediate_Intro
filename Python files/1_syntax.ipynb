    "## Print Statements and Comments\n",
    "Two things to immediately become familiar with are **print statements** and **comments**. They will help you figure out what is happening in your code and make it much easier to read.\n",
    "#### Print Statements\n",
    "```print()``` displays whatever is inside of the parenthesis. You can print multiple things in the same line by separating them with commas. These are very useful to check that everything is working correctly (or to find a problem!). \n",
    "#### Comments\n",
    "Comments are used to annotate code to make it easier to understand. Use a ```#``` sign at the beginning of a line to make a **single-line comment**. Use two sets of triple quotes (```\"\"\"``` or ```'''```) to mark the beginning and end of longer comments (**multi-line comments**). \n",
    "\n",
    "Comments *really* help when sharing your code with others, debugging, and revisiting old code!"
